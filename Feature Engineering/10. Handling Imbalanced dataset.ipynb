    "### What is Imbalanced Data?\n",
    "Imbalanced data typically refers to a problem with classification problems where the classes are not represented equally. For example, we may have a 2-class (binary) classification problem with 100 instances (rows). A total of 80 instances are labeled with Class-1 and the remaining 20 instances are labeled with Class-2. This is an imbalanced dataset and the ratio of Class-1 to Class-2 instances is 80:20 or more concisely 4:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a class imbalance problem on two-class classification problems as well as multi-class classification problems. Most techniques can be used on either. The remaining discussions will assume a two-class classification problem because it is easier to think about and describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imbalance is Common\n",
    "Most classification data sets do not have exactly equal number of instances in each class, but a small difference often does not matter. There are problems where a class imbalance is not just common, it is expected. For example, in datasets like those that characterize fraudulent transactions are imbalanced. The vast majority of the transactions will be in the “Not-Fraud” class and a very small minority will be in the “Fraud” class. Another example is customer churn datasets, where the vast majority of customers stay with the service (the “No-Churn” class) and a small minority cancel their subscription (the “Churn” class)."

It is the process of generating synthetic data that tries to randomly generate a sample of the attributes from observations in the minority class.

In simple terms, it looks at the feature space for the minority class data points and considers its k nearest neighbours.\n",
